# Main idea is to use recursion to go through each substitution
# To speed this up, we will NOT go through identical states (# of steps, state)

# I wrote senior this year so I cannot confirm this will pass, but running my own tests shows that it's capable of doing steps=15 :)

# Further optimizations if this does not pass:
# - Meet-in-the-middle trick (precompute half of the paths)
#     Should be able to reduce complexity by about a square root
#
# - Better pattern matching for each rule
#     Right now it is O(n^2) for each rule, we can improve this by either using Rabin Karp or any linear string function.
#
# - Convert to binary
#     Bitwise operations will speed up:
#     - Memoizing each state [O(1) instead of O(n)]
#     - Pattern matching [O(n) instead of O(n^2)]
#     - Creating the new string after substitution [O(1) instead of O(n)]

# So yeah lots can be done to improve this current algorithm :)
