## CanadianComputingCompetition
This repository contains some of solutions to some of the problems found in Waterloo's Canadian Computing Competition (CCC)

**NOTE: I've been noticing lots of copy-pasting to DMOJ, if you are going to do so, please play around with the code first, then try to implement it yourself (Don't just copy and paste directly please)** 

Most solutions will be written either in python2 or C++. My goal is to write as many valid solutions as possible that are well commented out and hopefully will be useful for someone who happens to stumble upon this repository :)

If possible I'll even attempt to point out some next step optimizations that can speed up the solution even further, but these won't be necessary for the problem itself. Maybe even some good resources to point to.

The following codes and solutions are tested on https://dmoj.ca/ and/or on the CCC Grader depending on which site's tests are stronger.

If requested I can write up and editorial for further explanations to one of the problem :)
