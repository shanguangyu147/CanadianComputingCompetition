## CanadianComputingCompetition
This repository contains some of solutions to some of the problems found in Waterloo's Candian Computing Competition (CCC)

Most solutions will be written either in python2 or C++. My goal is to write as many valid solutions as possible that are well commented out and hopefully will be useful for someone who happens to stumble upon this repository :)

If possible I'll even attempt to point out some next step optimizations that can speed up the solution even further, but these won't be necessary for the problem itself. Maybe even some good resources to point to.

The following codes and solutions are tested on https://dmoj.ca/ and/or on the CCC Grader depending on which site's tests are stronger.
