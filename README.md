## CanadianComputingCompetition
This repository contains some of solutions to some of the problems found in Waterloo's Candian Computing Competition (CCC)

Most solutions will be written either in python2 or C++. My goal is to write as many valid solutions as possible that are well commented out and hopefully will be useful for someone who happens to stumble upon this repository :)

The following codes and solutions are tested on https://dmoj.ca/ and/or on the CCC Grader depending on which site's tests are stronger.
